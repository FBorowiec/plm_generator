"Designed to spread a culture of excellence in performance throughout Fiat Industrial and its companies,
Performance & Leadership Management (PLM) enables the evaluation and channeling of individual and organizational results attitudes and behaviors,
giving individuals responsibility for and involvement in their own development. Starting with the top management,
at the beginning of the year managers share objectives and possible development initiatives with their staff in order to promote their professional growth.
At the end of the year, each individual is evaluated on their performance (i.e., achievement of business objectives)
and leadership (i.e., the ability to lead change, manage people and work as part of a team). Upon completion of this process,
the appraisal places the employee on a nine-square grid.
Through a continuous dialog, PLM strives to establish open, two-way communication.

Our model requires that leaders demonstrate their skills and abilities along two distinct venues:
leading the change process and leading people."
