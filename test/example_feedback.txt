John Doe has shown great commitment, enthusiasm and accountability for the team work.
This has turned out to be a key factor for his performance.
As noticed last year, his technical skills and technical communication are really high.
However he should simplify discussions when communicating with people with a different background and try being concise and linear.
He should also have more patience with new teammates that might require more time to onboard.
Although they might show little commitment it's really important he doesn't give up on him/her and rather tries to open up and root cause the problem.
If necessary the line manager is always available for escalation.
